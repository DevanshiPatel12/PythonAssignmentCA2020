Qn-1. Create three variables in a single line and assign different values to them and make sure their data types are different.
Like one is int, another one is float and the last one is a string.

>>> a,B,name = 1,1.5,'Devanshi'
>>> a
1
>>> B
1.5
>>> name
'Devanshi'

Qn-2. Create a variable of value type complex and swap it with another variable whose value is an integer.

>>> a = 1
>>> b = 1+1j
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(b)
<class 'complex'>
>>> c = b
>>> b = a
>>> a = c
>>> a
(1+1j)
>>> b
1
>>> type(a)
<class 'complex'>
>>> type(b)
<class 'int'>
