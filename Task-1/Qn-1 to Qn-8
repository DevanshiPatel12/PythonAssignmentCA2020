Qn-1. Create three variables in a single line and assign different values to them and make sure their data types are different.
Like one is int, another one is float and the last one is a string.

>>> a,B,name = 1,1.5,'Devanshi'
>>> a
1
>>> B
1.5
>>> name
'Devanshi'

Qn-2. Create a variable of value type complex and swap it with another variable whose value is an integer.

>>> a = 1
>>> b = 1+1j
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(b)
<class 'complex'>
>>> c = b
>>> b = a
>>> a = c
>>> a
(1+1j)
>>> b
1
>>> type(a)
<class 'complex'>
>>> type(b)
<class 'int'>

Qn-3. Swap two numbers using the third variable as the result name and do the same task without using any third variable.

>>> a,b = 10,20
>>> print('a:',a,'b:',b)
a: 10 b: 20
>>> result = a
>>> a = b
>>> b = result
>>> print('a:',a,'b:',b)
a: 20 b: 10

>>> a,b = 10,20
>>> print('a:',a,'b:',b)
a: 10 b: 20
>>> a = a + b
>>> b = a - b
>>> a = a - b
>>> print('a:',a,'b:',b)
a: 20 b: 10

Qn-4. Write a program to print the value given by the user by using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.

for Python 3.x
>>> name = input('Enter the name : ')
Enter the name : Devanshi
>>> name
'Devanshi'      ----------> type 'string'

for Python 2.x
>>> name = raw_input('Enter the name : ')
Enter the name : Devanshi
>>> name
'Devanshi'      -----------> type 'string'

if we use input() instead of raw_input() in Python 2.x
>>> n = input('Enter value : ')
Enter value : 10
>>> n
10              -----------> type 'int'

Qn-5. Write a program to complete the task given below:
      Ask the user to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 and add both of them to another variable call z.
      Use z for adding 30 into it and print the final result by using variable result.

a,b = input("Enter two numbers between 1 to 20: ").split(",")
z = int(a) + int(b)
result = z + 30
print("result : ", result)

Output:
Enter two numbers between 1 to 20: 1,4
result : 35

Qn-6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
      HINT: Printed output should say -  The input value data type is: int/float/string/etc

Ans. I tried this program in Python 2.7 using input() function
     because input() function can return type of the entered value

     I don’t know how to do it in Python 3.2.
     Because in Python 3.2, any type of input will be saved as a string first.

Qn-7. Create Variables using CamelCase, LadderCase and UPPERCASE.
      (Refer:   https://capitalizemytitle.com/camel-case/) - Variable Conventions to write

>>> CamelCase = 10
>>> camelCase = 20
>>> CAMELCASE = 30

Qn-8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again.
      Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

Ans. Yes it will change the value for variable ‘a’. Because memory location remains the same for that variable ‘a’.
